# rac-excel-workbooks
this contains the Excel workbooks that were driven by formulas for easy management of the INFA environment

the formulas are tightly coupled with the column positions; therefore it is not recommended to delete any existing column that is referenced by a formula
by convention, columns with a background color may contain formulas and cells with no color are free data erntry cells
